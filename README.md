# CV-Service-Project
## We will build two projects:

1. sprintboot-backend (server) – To develop REST API
2. react-frontend (client) – Consume REST API

# Client-Server Architecture 
# Build React JS Frontend Application
## Create a React UI with Create React App 
### Using npm
`npm init react-app react-frontend`\
`cd client`\
`npm start`\
`npm run dev`\

Runs the app in development mode. Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in the browser.

# Develop Spring Boot Backend Application
We will use Spring Data JPA to develop the repository layer and we use the H2 in-memory database to store the data.
